## Overview

This WebSocket server is designed to simulate real-time price updates for the NIFTY 50 and SENSEX indices. It uses the `ws` library for WebSocket communication and `express` for the HTTP server.

## Usage

Connect to the WebSocket server using a WebSocket client on port 8000 to receive dummy real-time updates for NIFTY 50 and SENSEX prices.
